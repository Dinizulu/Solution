        SovTech is a high reputable company in providing software solutions to clients and stakeholders with a
        rating of 4 out of 5 stars. This alone to me is inspiring as I know that there will be enough room for 
        me to improve due to ratings show clearly that my journey as newbie in the organization will be thrusted
        with high quality learning and access to resources wont be a problem as the organization caters for that.
         This for me will be a golden opportunity as I know that the organization through the program will give me
         a personal mentor, which this will be helpful and a stepping stone towards grasping required competencies
          and performance capabilities. The organization is already in the stream of building technologies using the 
          latest norms and tools, thus this need a mind that is hungry for knowledge with the aim to excell with success.
           I believe I will be the best suit for such due to what I love most is exploring and creating new solution through
            experimental testing.
